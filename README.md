# FaceDetection
# Face Detection and Tracking Project

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for creating a face detection and tracking system using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Albumentations. The system is built using the VGG16 architecture and trained to perform both face classification and localization.

## Installation

Install the required dependencies using the provided package list.

## Data Collection

Collect images using OpenCV. Use your webcam to capture a specified number of images and save them in a designated directory.

## Annotation

Use LabelMe to annotate the collected images. Label the regions of interest (faces) and save the annotations in JSON format.

## Data Preparation

Load the annotated images and their labels into TensorFlow. Prepare the data for training by splitting it into training, validation, and test sets.

## Augmentation

Apply image augmentation techniques using Albumentations. This enhances the dataset by introducing variations, improving the model's robustness.

## Model Building

Build the face detection and tracking model using the VGG16 architecture. Implement a custom model class in TensorFlow for training and prediction.

## Training

Train the model using the prepared dataset. Use custom loss functions for classification and localization tasks. Monitor the training process and adjust parameters as needed.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance on the test set. Visualize the predictions to verify the accuracy of face detection and bounding box localization.

## Real-Time Detection

Implement real-time face detection using OpenCV. Use the trained model to predict and draw bounding boxes around faces in live video feed from the webcam.

## Saving and Loading the Model

Save the trained model to a file for future use. Load the model to make predictions without retraining.
